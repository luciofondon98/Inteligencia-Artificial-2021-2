abstract = {Abstract It is well-known that few combinatorial optimization problems can be solved effectively by dynamic programming alone, since the number of vertices of the state space graph is enormous. What we are proposing here is a general relaxation procedure whereby the state-space associated with a given dynamic programming recursion is relaxed in such a way that the solution to the relaxed recursion provides a bound which could be embedded in general branch and bound schemes for the solution of the problem. This state space relaxation method is analogous to Langrangian relaxation in integer programming. This paper gives a survey of this new methodology, and gives, as examples, applications to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the time-constrained TSP and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Valid state space relaxations are discussed for these problems and several bounds are derived in each case. Subgradient optimization and “state space ascent” are discussed as methods of maximizing the resulting lower bounds. More details of the procedures surveyed in this paper can be found in [2, 3, 4].},

The G-VRP is of interest to policy makers who wish to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The GA is tested on a suite of benchmark, and real-world instances which include road speed and gradient data. Our solution approach incorporates elements of local and population search heuristics. Solutions are compared with routes currently used by drivers in a courier company. Reductions in emissions are achieved without incurring additional operational costs.}

In this paper, we develop a multi-depot green vehicle routing problem (MDGVRP) by maximizing revenue and minimizing costs, time and emission, and then, apply an improved ant colony optimization (IACO) algorithm that aims to efficiently solve the problem. The IACO model developed in this research uses an innovative approach in updating the pheromone that results in better solutions. The results achieved through the IACO demonstrate satisfying performance, which have higher solution quality when compared to the conventional ACO. The IACO algorithm used in this paper demonstrated a good level of responsiveness and simplicity when solving MDGVRP with multiple objectives.}
